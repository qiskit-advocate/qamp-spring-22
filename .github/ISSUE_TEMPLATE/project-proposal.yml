      description: one or two paragraphs describing the idea. Projects should take approximately 3 months to reasonably complete. The projects will 1) build technical skills, increase our number of core contributors, and work on meaningful projects we want to integrate into Qiskit or maintain; 2) Tackle problems that relate to advancing quantum computing. For example, publishing a quantum computing paper, building a successful local community, or increasing diversity.
